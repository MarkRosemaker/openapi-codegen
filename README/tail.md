## The openapi family

| Module | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [openapi](https://github.com/MarkRosemaker/openapi) | Parse, validate, and write OpenAPI 3.x specifications |
| [openapi-compare](https://github.com/MarkRosemaker/openapi-compare) | Compare specification objects — exact equality and shape equivalence |
| [openapi-edit](https://github.com/MarkRosemaker/openapi-edit) | Safe structural edits, such as renaming a schema and rewriting every `$ref` to it |
| [openapi-flatten](https://github.com/MarkRosemaker/openapi-flatten) | Promote inline definitions into named `components` entries |
| [openapi-compress](https://github.com/MarkRosemaker/openapi-compress) | Deduplicate and merge equivalent component schemas |
| [openapi-merge](https://github.com/MarkRosemaker/openapi-merge) | Merge schemas that were inferred independently from different samples |
| [openapi-enrich](https://github.com/MarkRosemaker/openapi-enrich) | Infer specification content from observed HTTP traffic |
| **openapi-codegen** (this module) | Generate Go types, clients, and servers from a specification |

This module sits at the end of the pipeline. If you have no specification to start
from, [`openapi-enrich`](https://github.com/MarkRosemaker/openapi-enrich) can build
one from recorded traffic — and the same recordings then become the generated
client's tests.
